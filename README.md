# Task-Management-App-with-Scheduled-Reminders
An Android app designed to help users manage tasks by scheduling reminders with priority-based delays. This app uses background threads to ensure timely notifications without impacting performance. Features include:

Task Scheduling: Users can input tasks with details and set reminders.
Priority-Based Delays: Tasks are executed sequentially based on priority, with delays managed by background threads.
Efficient Notification Handling: Ensures timely and non-intrusive notifications.
This project demonstrates efficient use of threading for scheduling notifications and handling task priorities in an Android environment.
